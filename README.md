# sql-challenge

## Background
It’s a beautiful spring day, and it’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.


## Data Modeling
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables


## Data Engineering
* Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
* For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite key, which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.
* Be sure to create tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys.
* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
